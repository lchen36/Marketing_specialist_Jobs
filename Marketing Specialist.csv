Like our small business clients, we are a diverse team of builders, dreamers, and entrepreneurs, so at the heart of every decision we make is the idea that if it doesn’t serve our clients, it doesn’t serve us.

So, we created the leading online marketplace for small business loans. We’ve helped small businesses get $11.7 billion in 116,000 loans to 81,000 small business owners. In a single year, we unlocked 115,000 jobs and contributed $8 billion to the global economy. There’s never been a better time to join!

Be part of the team that changes everything. Let’s build the place where small businesses can get the funding they need to win and leave a legacy behind, forever.

This role sits within “Business Services”. The engine of Funding Circle - we keep FC running. Whatever the subject area, we turn dreams into reality and help small business win. Funding Circle Marketing drives growth, but not just Funding Circle’s. We connect small businesses with the funds they need to grow to help small businesses continue to play a vital role in the U.S. economy. We are ambitious and passionate about helping more small businesses.

About the role:

Marketing Operations is the backbone of any successful marketing team and Marketing Analytics is the source of tangible value. We are seeking an analyst to assist with both, with the overarching goal of enabling Marketing team members to drive value. You have the ability to improve not only the pipes behind the scenes but determine how the team tests into new initiatives and surface insights to drive better outcomes. As such, you will focus on keeping the lights on today, improving processes for tomorrow, and supporting innovative acquisition efforts to drive growth well into the future.

Digital Marketing: you will be responsible for the pipelines between marketing platforms (such as Facebook, Google Ads), our website, and management/measurement/visualization platforms such as Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics and Tableau.

Offline Marketing: you will be responsible for the process to get campaigns out the door and create measurement frameworks to monitor success and weave together a comprehensive (offline and online) view of success.

This role requires someone who's analytical, detail oriented and has baseline knowledge of the digital marketing landscape and marketing attribution. You enjoy diving into data to analyze performance just as much as you enjoy designing a framework to enable that analysis. You believe done is better than perfect but recognize you can’t scale on a flimsy foundation. You thrive in a fast-paced environment but can stay engaged with routine tasks.

As the Marketing Operations Analyst you will be responsible for…

Marketing Infrastructure:

Tactical:
You will own Google Tag Manager and the process by which our website communicates with external management/measurement tools and platforms
You will own existing and develop new ETL processes to ensure internal access to marketing platform data and accurate data sources for internal reporting. This includes liaising with the Data Team to identify, fix, and improve our data pipelines.
You will oversee day-to-day data execution and define and document business practices
Strategic:
Work with manager and campaign managers to determine pixel set-up that reflects platform limitations and measurement framework.
Marketing Reporting:

Tactical:
You will own Tableau based reports to ensure key stakeholders have access to accurate and timely information at varying levels of granularity
You will oversee reporting tools to ensure items are entered correctly by team members and reflected correctly in end-user reports
You will provide overviews of Marketing’s performance to key stakeholders and, with the help of your manager, craft the narrative.
Strategic:
You will continuously question processes and refine, rebuild, and create reports to serve existing and future needs with a focus on surfacing insights.
Marketing Analytics
Tactical:
Thrive in a data-driven, test-and-learn culture with your passion for telling stories with data - not only surfacing marketing (online and offline) and social media insights, but also presenting these insights and recommendations to the wider organization, including executives, to influence change.
Apply sophisticated computational, statistical, and modeling techniques in support of campaign optimization; techniques include A/B and multivariate testing, predictive analysis, data mining, marketing mix modeling, attribution modeling
You will assist channel managers in tying platform’s source of truth to internal metrics with a goal of improving efficiency and conversion through underwritten funnel.
You will conduct ad-hoc analysis to dig into performance and answer marketing related questions for key stakeholders including Risk
Strategic:
You will constantly innovate on measurement framework to assist with spend allocation decisions, campaign execution, and internal storytelling
About you:
3+ years in Marketing data analytics. An understanding of the digital and offline marketing landscape and management/measurement tools. Advanced proficiency with Excel and data evaluation skills.
Hands-on experience applying statistical approaches/concepts, including A/B tests, credibility, statistical significance, and multivariate testing
Experience running existing and writing new SQL based queries
Attention to detail and the ability to understand the nuances of marketing programs and digital tracking
Bias towards action. Some questions just need answers while others should fuel further investigation. Proactively probing data, asking questions, and seeking clarity.
Demonstrated willingness to learn and a curious nature. We have a great team but sometimes you will become the SME on a tool you have never used before. Be open, flexible, and eager to expand your skill set.
Extremely detail and process-oriented with a drive to improve whatever you touch. A view that the current way does not mean it is right, based on a philosophy that done is better than perfect but scale isn’t possible on a flimsy foundation.
Bonus:
Familiarity with business intelligence tools (Tableau, etc)
Experience with tag management tools (Google Tag Manager, etc) and exposure to engineering component

More About Venafi:

Venafi is the undisputed heavy weight champion in Machine Identity Protection. Why? Because we created the category and are light years ahead of anyone that would consider competing! Gartner has recognized Venafi as number one in our space and as it turns out, one is NOT the loneliest number!

Venafi is the inventor of the technology that secures and protects keys and certificates. Venafi protects machine identity types by orchestrating cryptographic keys and digital certificates for SSL/TLS, IoT, mobile and SSH. Many of the largest organizations in the world use Venafi.

Billions of dollars have been spent protecting usernames and passwords and almost nothing protecting keys and certificates—organizations are just now realizing that protecting keys and certificates is as important as protecting usernames and passwords. The bad guys know this and are using stolen or forged keys and certificates to attack networks and steal data. In fact, Gartner says 50% of network attacks will use certificates.

Come help us protect the world!",3.7,"Venafi

Company Description
Located in Howard County, Maryland, Iron World is the fastest growing manufacturer and distributor of top-quality ornamental fencing and slide gates in the country. Our world class products meet the highest standards of excellence for design, durability and functionality. You will find our products at such places as the Pentagon, the Washington Monument, the Washington Nationals’ Stadium, Norfolk Naval Base, Badger Stadium, Quantico, New Jersey Devil’s Arena, Patriots Stadium and numerous bridges, highways and schools throughout the country.

At Iron World, our products are made from raw steel, giving us the ability to make tubing, posts and pickets of all shapes and sizes. Once the steel has been formed and posts are cut to your size requirements, they go through our extensive coating process. We coat our products using a five stage pre-treatment, ending with a non-chromatic conversion coating to seal the surface and provide additional corrosion protection. Fourteen oscillating, automatic spray guns then apply a polyester powder to the G90 galvanized steel to ensure all parts of the iron fence and gate products are evenly reached with a 3.0-3.5 mil thickness of coating.

Our iron fences and gates are coated pre-assembly to ensure a smooth, consistent finish that resists cracking, flaking and peeling at the panel’s pivot points. This process ensures a full measure of protection in the areas where moisture accumulates and rust begins. Our in-house powder coating line is the largest in the manufacturing industry; over 1200 feet in length and equipped to handle fencing and gates that are up to 50 feet in length, 8 feet in height, and 27 inches in width. To ensure top quality of the powder coating process, two manual gun technicians inspect the final coat of all materials.

Once your decorative iron fencing and gates are ready to be delivered, we place them in polyurethane bags and shrink wrap them closed with heat. This ensures that contaminates cannot enter the packaging, preventing scratches and abrasions during transit. Everyone on the Iron World staff is focused on providing the highest quality product and service at a competitive price. No hidden charges – the price we provide is complete.",1.0,"Iron World Manufacturing, LLC

More than a job


Where you work isn't just a career decision -- it's a life decision. We get it. That's why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.
4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays. Whether it's hiking to a waterfall in Costa Rica or bonding with your couch, we all need downtime. All Gurus get four weeks paid time off, 10 sick days, and enough holiday to make a banker blush.
Let's get lunch. Lunches are catered three times per week, and our kitchen stays stocked with a smorgasbord of the team's most requested snacks and drinks.
Parking is on us. We have your Downtown parking covered. We offer paid garage parking nearby the office. We also have perks for going green by walking and taking public transit.
We've got you covered. We offer insurance plans that pay for 100% of your medical, dental, and vision, and 80% for your family/dependents.
Gender-neutral paid parental leave. Expanding your family? We offer 12 weeks of gender-neutral paid parental leave, and reimburse up to $10,000 for eligible adoption expenses.
$1,000 continuing education budget. All Gurus get $250 a quarter to spend on personal development, and 2 hours each week reserved for learning something new.
What's the interview process like at ACG?


Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own. You shouldn't have to burn through a week of sick time or all your best out-of-office excuses just to put feelers out for a new career opportunity. We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It's our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.

Once you submit an application, we'll review it. If you're a good fit, you'll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we'll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it's really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.

A Few Signs That The Job Isn't Right for You
Can’t someone else do that?”, “That’s not my responsibility”, and “Why does this depend on me?” are routine parts of your inner dialogue.
You’ve said, “The deadline is tomorrow, but it’s 6:00 PM so it’ll have to wait” and meant it.
You assess someone who lets a deadline slip because they’re working 70 hours per week serving clients as just “not having it all together.”
You often ask questions of others that can be answered with a brief Google search, phone call, or record check.
You believe file versioning and naming conventions are a stupid waste of time.
You think it’s unreasonable when stakeholders expect you to provide information that will give them assurance that tasks are being completed appropriately.
If you don’t know what to do next, you wait. And wait.
You’re more worried about what people think of you than the quality of the outcome you produce.
You resent ambiguous or unstructured situations and require perfect clarity at all times to be happy at work.
Changes to plan, multiple revisions, and new assignments that pop up unexpectedly are unacceptable to you.
You are comfortable letting team members down.
